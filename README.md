# LINUX-APPIMAGE-IDE
MAKE LINUX APPIMAGE SOFTER USING PYTHON
In this project, youâ€™ll learn how to create your own Linux AppImage software using Python.
AppImage is a portable packaging format that allows you to run applications on any Linux distribution without installation â€” just like .exe files on Windows.

This project covers:
ðŸ”¹ Building a GUI application using Python (with frameworks like PyQt5, Tkinter, or Kivy)
ðŸ”¹ Bundling all dependencies and resources into one package
ðŸ”¹ Creating an AppDir structure and generating the final .AppImage file
ðŸ”¹ Making the AppImage executable on any Linux system (Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, Debian, etc.)
